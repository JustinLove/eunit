module Test exposing (Test(..), it, describe)

{-| This module provides means to define a test suite. Test suite is a tree formed from other test suites which
has tests as its leafs. API is similar to that of Jasmine for JavaScript.

# Definition
@docs Test.Suite, Test.Test

# Constructing Tests
@docs it, describe

import Expectation exposing (Expectation)

{-| Tests that can be executed. Tests can be either simple tests that have only one expectation
or test suites which group other test suites and simple tests together.

 Test suite consisting of two tests

    Suite
      "mySuite"
      [
        Test "test +" eql 2 (1 + 1)
        , Test "test -" eql 2 (3 - 1)
      ]

 It is expected that tests and suite are constructed using helper methods `describe` and `it` rather
 than by using `Suite` and `Test` directly.

 Same test suite consisting of two tests, but declared using `describe` and `it`

    describe
      "mySuite"
      [
        it "should add" eql 2 (1 + 1)
        , it "should subtract" eql 2 (3 - 1)
      ]
-}
type Test = Suite String (List Test) | Test String Expectation

{-| Constructs a single simple test.

 Simple test

    it "should add" eql 2 (1 + 1)
-}
it: String -> Expectation -> Test
it = Test

{-| Constructs a test suite consisting of other test suites or simple tests.

 Test suite

         [
           it "should be commutative"
             eql (1 + 2) (2 + 1)
           it "should have neutral element"
             eql (0 + 2) 2
         ]

         [
           it "should be commutative"
             eql (3 * 2) (2 * 3)
           it "should have neutral element"
             eql (1 * 2) 2
         ]
    ]
